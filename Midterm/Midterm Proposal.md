# Midterm Proposal

Concept: My plan is to create an electronics and video game news and review site. I'd like to make posts about the latest developments in the field of video games, reporting on the latest announcements. In addition to reporting on the latest news on games in development, I'd also be posting reviews on the latest releases. In addition to games, I'd also be posting news on the latest technology, more specifically focusing on computer hardware. For this project, I'd limit myself to only a few posts, possibly just three in each section.

Existing website: https://www.gamefaqs.com/

Mockups: https://github.com/apr340/DM2193/blob/master/Midterm/Main%20Page.png

Concepts I have learned: Nav bars, using fonts from google, drop down menus.

Concepts I'll have to learn: I'll need to figure out how to create a slideshow where I could put the most important news.
