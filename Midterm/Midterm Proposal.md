# Midterm Proposal

Concept: My plan is to create an electronics and video game news and review site. I'd like to make posts about the latest developments in the field of video games, reporting on the latest announcements. In addition to reporting on the latest news on games in development, I'd also be posting reviews on the latest releases. In addition to games, I'd also be posting news on the latest technology, more specifically focusing on computer hardware. For this project, I'd limit myself to only a few posts, possibly just three in each section.
